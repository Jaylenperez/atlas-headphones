## :memo: <span id="description">Description</span>
In this project, you will implement from scratch, without any library, a web page. You will use all HTML/CSS/Accessibility/Responsive design knowledges that you learned previously.

You wonâ€™t have a lot of instruction, you are free to implement it the way that you want.
## :school: <span id="learning objective">Learning Objective</span>

The objective is simple: Have a fully functional web page that looks the same as the designer file.
## :floppy_disk: <span id="requirements">Requirements</span>

* You are not allowed to import external CSS framework (like Bootstrap)
* You are not to use Javascript
